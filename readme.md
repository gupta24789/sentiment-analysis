## Sentiment Analysis

1. [Naive Bayes](https://github.com/gupta24789/sentiment-analysis/blob/main/02_naive_bayes.ipynb)
   - created features : pos_freq, neg_freq
3. [Logistis Regression - ml](https://github.com/gupta24789/sentiment-analysis/blob/main/03_logistic_regression_ml.ipynb)
   - created features : pos_freq, neg_freq, bias
   - used sklearn LogisticRegression model
5. [Logistic Regression - torch](https://github.com/gupta24789/sentiment-analysis/blob/main/04_logistic_regression_torch.ipynb)
   - created features : pos_freq, neg_freq, bias
   - used feedforward network
   - implemented in torch
7. [Logistic Regression - lighting](https://github.com/gupta24789/sentiment-analysis/blob/main/05_logistic_regression_lighting.ipynb)
   - created features : pos_freq, neg_freq, bias
   - used feedforward network
   - implemented in lighting
9. [Logistic Regression - Embedding Layer](https://github.com/gupta24789/sentiment-analysis/blob/main/06_logistic_regression_embedding_layer.ipynb)
   - used embedding layer to learn the embedding
   - implemented in lighting
11. [Logistic Regression - Transformer](https://github.com/gupta24789/sentiment-analysis/blob/main/07_logistic_regression_bert.ipynb)
    - used transformers model to get the embedding
    - fine tune last layer
    - implemented in lighting
